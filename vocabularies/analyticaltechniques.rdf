    <prefLabel>Atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS)</prefLabel>
    <definition>Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) is a spectroanalytical procedure for the quantitative determination of chemical elements employing the absorption of optical radiation (light) by free atoms in the gaseous state. In analytical chemistry the technique is used for determining the concentration of a particular element (the analyte) in a sample to be analyzed. AAS can be used to determine over 70 different elements in solution or directly in solid samples (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_absorption_spectroscopy)</definition>

    <definition>Cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectroscopy is a subset of the analytical technique known as atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (AFS). Used in the measurement of trace amounts of volatile heavy metals such as mercury, cold vapour AFS makes use of the unique characteristic of mercury that allows vapour measurement at room temperature. Free mercury atoms in a carrier gas are excited by a collimated ultraviolet light source at a wavelength of 253.7 nanometres. The excited atoms re-radiate their absorbed energy (fluoresce) at this same wavelength. (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_vapour_atomic_fluorescence_spectroscopy)</definition>

    <definition>Electrothermal Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (ETAAS) (also known as Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS)) is a type of spectrometry that uses a graphite-coated furnace to vaporize the sample. Briefly, the technique is based on the fact that free atoms will absorb light at frequencies or wavelengths characteristic of the element of interest (hence the name atomic absorption spectrometry). Within certain limits, the amount of light absorbed can be linearly correlated to the concentration of analyte present. Free atoms of most elements can be produced from samples by the application of high temperatures.</definition>

LC-MS is a powerful technique used for many applications which has very high sensitivity and selectivity. Generally its application is oriented towards the general detection and potential identification of chemicals in the presence of other chemicals (in a complex mixture). The limitations of LC-MS in urine analysis drug screening is that it often fails to distinguish between specific metabolites, in particular with hydrocodone and its metabolites.</definition>

    <notation>HR-CS-AAS</notation>
    <prefLabel>High resolution continuum source atomic absorption spectrometry (HR-CS-AAS)</prefLabel>
    <definition>When a continuum radiation source is used for AAS measurement it is indispensable to work with a high-resolution monochromator. The resolution has to be equal to or better than the half width of an atomic absorption line (about 2 pm) in order to avoid losses of sensitivity and linearity of the calibration graph. These spectrometers use a compact double monochromator with a prism pre-monochromator and an echelle grating monochromator for high resolution. A linear charge coupled device (CCD) array with 200 pixels is used as the detector. The second monochromator does not have an exit slit; hence the spectral environment at both sides of the analytical line becomes visible at high resolution. As typically only 3–5 pixels are used to measure the atomic absorption, the other pixels are available for correction purposes. One of these corrections is that for lamp flicker noise, which is independent of wavelength, resulting in measurements with very low noise level; other corrections are those for background absorption, as will be discussed later.</definition>

    <definition>Isotope dilution analysis is a technique to increase the precision and accuracy of chemical analysis. The isotopic composition of the sample will be slightly changed. Then, by measuring each isotope, the amount of lead in the original sample can be calculated. In a typical gas chromatography analysis, isotopic dilution can decrease the error of injection from 5% to 1%. It can also be used in mass spectrometry (commonly referred to as isotopic dilution mass spectrometry or IDMS), in which the isotopic ratio can be determined with precision typically better than 0.25%.</definition>

    <definition>Spectrophotometry is the quantitative measurement of the reflection or transmission properties of a material as a function of wavelength. It is more specific than the general term electromagnetic spectroscopy in that spectrophotometry deals with visible light, near-ultraviolet, and near-infrared, but does not cover time-resolved spectroscopic techniques.
Spectrophotometry involves the use of a spectrophotometer. A spectrophotometer is a photometer that can measure intensity as a function of the light source wavelength. Important features of spectrophotometers are spectral bandwidth and linear range of absorption or reflectance measurement.</definition>
