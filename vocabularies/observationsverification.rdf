    <definition>Data has not gone through (or has gone through minimal) checks by data provider/owner.  Some basic screening criteria in order to exclude clearly faulty data as far as possible maybe used. The data with this data flag is considered provisional and can be used as provisional. This flag is independant to the validity status.</definition>
    <scopeNote>Mainly used when Up To Date data is reported. Data subject to changes as further qa/qc is carried out.</scopeNote>

    <definition>Data has gone through initial checks by data provider/owner. Extra quality assurance and quality control verifications have been carried out compared to "Not verified" data. Data Verification might be carried out on an ongoing basis and is nominally a process to "clean-up" the initial "Not verified" data. Any corrections to the data made during the verification process are changes the status flag to "Preliminary verified". The data with this data flag is considered provisional and can be used as provisional.  This flag is independant to the validity status.</definition>
